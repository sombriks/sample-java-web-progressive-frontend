# Devlog

Small obs made creating this sample so far

## 2020-07-30

So far, only intellij knows how to properly handle gradle multiproject setup

## 2020-07-31

Filled bug on eclipse regarding the class not found thing.

Netbeans doesn't even get closer to work.

VSCode ~~also fails to deal with multiproject~~ seems to work 

Added the no-script approach in order to get that 1998-2003 feeling.

## 2020-08-01

Added [gradle cargo plugin](https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-cargo-plugin/blob/master/README.md)
to choose any ide/editor and still be able to deploy on development
